# Real-Time-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
A real-time driver alertness monitoring system built using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras. The system uses a webcam feed to detect the driverâ€™s face and eyes, analyzing eye closure duration to determine drowsiness. If signs of fatigue are detected, an alert signal is sent to the driver.
